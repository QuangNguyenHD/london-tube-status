# london-tube-status

This project follows a series of articles on Medium that follow the journey of creating a simple Android app to display London Underground lines statuses.

It will be done using Clean Architecture and the plan is for it to be 100% Kotlin. Initially just code but eventual;ly move gradle scripts to Kotlin as well using Kotlin DSL.

Each article will be tagged in the ``article_#`` format so it's easier to track all changes.

You can check all the articles below:
